Use the PDF template to cut the aluminum pieces from 3-4mm material.

The u-shaped piece is optional.
You can either solder the thick wire bend to an u-shape directly to the  pcb as before 
or cut this aluminum piece and screw it with m2 screws to the pcb.
I have not tested the u-shaped alu piece yet because it is quite difficult to manufacture it with hand tools.

You can also take a look at the 3d and dxf drawings to manufacture the aluminum parts with a cnc or something else.
